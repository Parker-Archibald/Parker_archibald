This was a fun little project that was mostly focused around frontend work, but it was a project that I enjoyed. <b>PLEASE BE AWARE</b> - I did pass a non-adult filter to TMDB's API, but some movies do 
not filter out. The <a href='https://nextjs.org/' target='_blank'>Next.js</a> application is fully responsive and uses the TMDB API to get movies in a couple of different categories:

- Upcoming
- Top Rated
- Popular

## Functionality
Each movie is clickable and brings you to a seperate page with details about that movie. Since this is a strictly UI project and not wanting any copyright issues, the movie doesn't actually play.
Once on the movie page, if there are any movies that are similar, a list of them will be displayed.

I used <a href='https://ui.shadcn.com/' target='_blank'>Shadcn</a> for some of the UI elements, such as the Genre dropdown and the search bar. You can use the genre dropdown to see a list of movies in 
the selected genere and you can also search for movies which will provide you with a list of movies related to what you searched. Each API call is cached on the server with a 
24 hour revalidation - meaning that after the initial API call pages are displayed super quick. All in all, this was a super fun project that I think looks visually stunning!

I've always wanted to start a blog, but was never sure what to write. I've decided to document my journey as a Junior developer, which will include what I learn from month to month.

## My Decision

When I first started programming, everything felt so new and exciting, but very confusing. I had previously learned another language - [Portuguese](#) - and this was just like learning that.
In Portuguese, there are several different ways to conjugate verbs depending on who or what that verb is applying to. Once I understood the basics of these conjugations, I was able to conjugate
just about any verb. Similarly, in programming, as I learned the basics I was more able to apply more difficult ideas and methodologies to my code. After about 4 years of programming with [ReactJS](#) and [NextJS](#), I have decided
to document what I learn each month. I hope that this can not only help me to remember what I have learned and give me a place where I can reference those learnings, but also maybe help any other
junior programmers who are trying to break into the development industry.

## What I learned in December

I have been working on a project for an [Image Consultant](#) who is a client of mine. In their website they have several options for services that potential customers can look at. Since there could be
a large selection of services, we decided to add a search bar where customers could search for tags or service names to find what they are looking for quicker. I wanted this search input to filter the
results without having to click on any button. *(Below is just a simple example)*

```jsx
const [searchInput, setSearchInput] = useState('')
return (
  <div>
    <input type='search' onChange={(e) => setSearchInput(e.target.value)}/>
  </div>
)
```

What I kept running into was that each character entered into the search input would start filtering out which services were showing. Although this technically did what I was wanting, I knew it would be
better to only filter after the customer was done typing, or at least took a short break.

## My Solution

As I searched for possible solutions, I came across the idea of [debouncing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-debounce-example/), which, in my case, would delay the filtering until a defined
amount of time after the user was done typing. Essentially, the process would be:

1. Capture the user's input.
2. Set a timeout on updating the searchInput state.
3. If the user kept typing and the function to update the state was called again, clear the timeout and then reset the timeout
4. Once the user stops typing, the timeout will be allowed to finish, thus updating the state and filtering the services.

What I ended up doing was creating a variable where the timeout would be saved.

```jsx
let tempVar;
```
Then I created a function that would first clear the new variable of the old timeout and assign the new timeout to it. This function would be called each time the search input had a change.

```jsx
const updateSearchInput = (input) => {
  clearTimeout(tempVar);
  tempVar = setTimeOut(() => {
    setSearchInput(input)
  }, 1000)
}
```

This ensured that each change made to the search input would reset the timeout on updating the filter. This really improved the flow of searching for items and I believe will affect the user's experience.

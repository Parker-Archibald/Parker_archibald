A big part of a customer&apos;s experience is how quickly they can get to where they are wanting to go. Having cached API calls on server components not only speeds up the data fetching process for all customers, but also improves your API call limitations.

Caching and re-fetching API calles is super simple in Nextjs with the [Revalidate](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating) option. In the past month I utilized
while building out [Disney Plus Clone](https://disney-plus-clone-9g12.vercel.app/) for my portfolio. In this project, I fetch movie data from the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) 
database, and display lists of movies and suggested movies based off of that movie. If this was a high traffic webpage, having each page calling the API would be very cumbersome. Luckily, we have
the [Revalidate](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating) option in Nextjs!

```js
const data = fetch(url)
const response = await fetch(url);
```

## Revalidate

By default, Next.js automatically caches the returned values of `fetch()` in the Data Cache on the server, which means that the fetched data can be-reused without having to re-fetch it. 

Revalidating is the process of clearing out the Data Cache and re-fetching the latest data. This can be done in two ways:

- [Time-based revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#time-based-revalidation)
- [On-demand or Forced revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#on-demand-revalidation)

### Time-based revalidation
Sometimes you want to be able to only re-fetch data after a certain amount of time, for example, an API refreshes their data at the end of each day. There would be no use in fetching this data over and over
so being able to only re-fetch it after a certain amount of time would be extremely useful. Adding the next revalidate option with the amount of time ensures that the cached data from the server is used
until the specified amount of time is reached to revalidate. In the case below, we will re-fetch the data if the fetch request is sent 24 hours after the initial `fetch()`

```js
const data = fetch(url, {next: {revalidate: 60 * 60 * 24}})
const response = await fetch(url);
```

## On-demand Revalidation
On-demand revalidation allows you to manually revalidate based on an event (for example, if a form was submitted). This option allows you to use a tag-based or path-based approach.

1. In Next.js, you have the option to "Tag" your cached entry with one or more tags. These tags are then usable to force a revalidation.
```js
const data = fetch(url, {next: {tags: ['Movies']}})
const response = await fetch(url);
```
2. When you want to force a revalidation, you simply utilize `revalidateTag()` from `next/cache` to revalidate the cached item by passing in the tag that you set earlier
```js
import {revalidateTag} from 'next/cache'

const revalidateMovies = async () => {
    await revalidateTag('Movies)
}
```


Next.js has some really amazing tools to provide users with seamless experiences, and I think that having the ability to control caching on fetched datas is extremely powerful.
